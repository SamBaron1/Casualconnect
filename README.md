### 4. Environment Variables Setup `.env` 

```env backend
JWT_SECRET=2d69c4a337383ae5660f2dda62419a0f2948ae35a15e774064ad70fd9148910d13acbc6ba8c64007872d6cdbed39c1dcc42ec89076b21b8754db14fc49308a78
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=Samm@2001
DB_NAME=casualconnect
DB_PORT=3306
EMAIL=samuelng0001@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=smht abui zfns cigi
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Samm2001
# Server Port
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BPRVYlTEv4AwCzujZSbgTu0QSQr810Oed6WOEqFC0VyrQh-CXJJVK3KcSAVfnG62VV2PypchPL_76_80w7yzLos

```

```env root
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Then start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---
### 5. Using DevTunnels
Replace localhost with your DevTunnel URLs for testing:
Change visibility to public

Frontend runs on: `https://16kxld3c-3000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/`  
Backend runs on: `https://16kxld3c-5000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/`

Ensure APIs and WebSockets are pointed to DevTunnel endpoints.

---

### 6. üì© Email Setup (Nodemailer)

- Create a Gmail or SMTP-compatible email account.
- Enable **less secure apps** or use an **app password**.
- Add credentials to `.env`.

---

### 7. üîî Push Notifications Setup

Generate your **VAPID keys** [here](https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/) and add to `.env`.

Frontend uses **Service Workers** to subscribe and receive notifications.
